## Problem Statement

<p align = "justify">Introduction and advertisement are very important for business, therefore, the proposed solution of having a portfolio website that will help a business, company or personal career a lot because the website contains information about the company's information, sales, statistics, services, and contact information. The company can also put the information to help their customers and the customers can find some useful information about the company or the individual to who's that portfolio belongs.</p>

* **Dark Mode** - I have used the Javascript to code the darkmode functionality. The way the code is written such that it saves the mode into the memory, so that it remembers what was the recently used option. To access the darkmode function please go the [main.js](assets/js/main.js) file


* **Linking to #id on different webpage** -- As you are reading the code you will understand that I have used the concept of accessing the id from a different page. All you need to do is append the `id`` at the end of the page. For example `index.html#id-name`. 


* **Dynamic Navigation Bar** -- Both the navigation bar and the footer are dynamic, not static. If you are using a phone then you will see the difference. All the options in the navigation bar have icons next to them. This increases the readability of the options and makes it easy to
